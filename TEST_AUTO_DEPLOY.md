# ðŸš€ Auto-Deployment Test

This file was created to test the automatic deployment system.

**Test Details:**
- Created: $(date)
- Purpose: Trigger automatic deployment workflow
- Expected: GitHub Actions should detect this change and deploy to Hostinger

**What should happen:**
1. âœ… GitHub Actions detects the push
2. âœ… Builds the application  
3. âœ… Deploys to Hostinger server
4. âœ… Restarts PM2 processes
5. âœ… Performs health checks
6. âœ… Creates version tag

**Monitor progress at:**

**If this works, automatic deployment is successful! ðŸŽ‰**
