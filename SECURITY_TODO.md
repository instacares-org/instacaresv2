# Security Improvements - Before Production

## Critical (Must Do Before Launch)
- [ ] Generate strong JWT_SECRET (use: openssl rand -base64 32)
- [ ] Set up proper SSL certificate
- [ ] Move rate limiting to Redis/database
- [ ] Add email verification requirement
- [ ] Implement password strength requirements (min 8 chars, numbers, special chars)

## Important (Should Do)
- [ ] Add refresh token implementation
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Add session management in database
- [ ] Set up account lockout after 10 failed attempts
- [ ] Add password reset flow with secure tokens

## Nice to Have
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Login history tracking
- [ ] Device management
- [ ] Suspicious activity alerts
- [ ] Audit logging for all auth events

## Current Security Features âœ…
- JWT authentication
- Bcrypt password hashing
- HTTP-only secure cookies
- Rate limiting (5 attempts/15 min)
- Account status validation
- User type verification
